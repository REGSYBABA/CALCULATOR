# CALCULATOR

THIS IS THE LAST PROJECT FROM THE ODIN PROJECT ON THE FOUNDATIONS PATH.

 # OUTCOME
 THIS WAS A FUN PROJECT AS IT HELPED US PRACTICE OUR CSS SKILLS, ALONGSIDE OUR JAVASRIPT TOO.
 I LEARNED AND RE-LEARNED BETTER JAVASRIPT, USED HTML5 SEMANTIC ELEMENTS FOR BETTER READABILITY AND STRUCTURE, IMPLEMENTING NEATER CODES AND GETTING MORE CSS KNOWLEDGE AS I HAVENT TOUCHED IT IN A WHILE SINCE FOCUSING ON JAVASCRIPT

 # FIRST PHASE
 HTML IMPLEMENTATION AND MINOR STYLING(I MADE USE OF GRID FELT MORE FUN, INSTEAD OF FLEX.)

 # SECOND PHASE
 GETTING THE NUMBERS AND OPERATORS ON THE CALCULATOR WORKING WHEN CLICKED ON.

 # THIRD PHASE
 MAKING SURE THE CALCULATIONS WERE ACCURATELY WORKING WITH SIMPLE OPERATIONS LIKE 
 - ADDITION
 - MULTIPLICATION
 - SUBTRACTION
 - DIVISION
 - PERCENTAGE(NOT SIMPLE I KNOW)

 # FOURTH PAHSE
 I MADE SURE THE CALCULATOR DOESN'T GIVE EXCESS NUMBERS / OVERFLOWING NUMBERS...I ROUNDED UP THE NUMBERS TO LIKE FIVE.

 # FIFTH PHASE
 I DECIDED TO ADD KEYBORAD SUPPORT VERY FUN AS WE HAVE LEARNT IT BEFORE FROM ODIN SO I HAD TO RACK AND RACK MY HEADS ON REMEMBERING IT.

 # SIXTH PHASE 
 I ALSO ADDED MORE STYLING, I ADDED DARK THEME AND LIGHT THEME.
